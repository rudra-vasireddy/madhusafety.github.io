									July 22, 2023, Madhukar Vasireddy was Daniel’s client
									I had the pleasure of working with many professionals in my career path, but Mr. Madhukar is someone who I will always remember fondly. Having worked with him for 4-years in the Katara Twin Tower Project, Lusail Qatar. I must say he is an excellent HSE professional. 
					
									Mr. Madhukar was the principal contractor’s HSE Manager for HBK and I learned a lot from him. He’s always willing to lend a hand to anyone who needs it and was instrumental in the outstanding achievement of the 45Million LTI free recorded on the project. 
					
									I must say he is an energetic HSE professional. As his sub-contractor at the time, I was impressed by his work ethics and managerial skills also with his great sense of humor, work ethics and commitment to responsibilities with effective communication skills.
					
									I am glad to have worked with him and have no hesitation in recommending him to potential employers.</p>
